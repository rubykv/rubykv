##

I have close to 11 years of experience working for various MNC's as a Java Programmer and Designer. 

I'm a freelancer now, I write about tech and personal finance in Medium and love exploring new tech stacks and design patterns.

Apart from tech and words, I love to travel and hence the location-dependent lifestyle had to be dumped.

Currently fascinated by Agri-Tech and Renewable Energy Technology.
