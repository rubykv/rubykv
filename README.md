I'm a Backend Programmer and Tech Blogger. I write in medium https://medium.com/@rubyshiv about my tech journey and life experiences. 

I'm from Kerala, India. Apart from programming, writing and reading, I love mountains. Highest peak I have climbed so far is 19,000 ft but my favorites are mostly somewhere between 10,000 and 12,000 ft, that's where I have always found peace.

Do say a "Hi" if you come across this page, its fun to meet new people.
